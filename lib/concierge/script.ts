/**
 * Shivi's script — every word she says on the converted journey, in one place.
 *
 * Voice rules:
 * - First person singular. She did it, she's doing it, she'll do it.
 * - Each turn says at most three things: what just happened, what she's doing,
 *   what she needs (or when she'll be back).
 * - COLD-OPEN RULE: the journey plays out over days, so every turn must read
 *   correctly to someone who just reopened the app — lead lines are standalone
 *   news ("Your Creta is reserved in your name."), never reactions ("Done —")
 *   unless the user acted seconds ago on the previous screen. Stamps are real
 *   dates with event anchors ("Wed 23 Apr · after the dealer's call") — never
 *   journey bookkeeping like "Day 1"; omit them when no time has passed.
 *   Day-boundary turns greet the return ("Morning, Sharath —", "Welcome back —").
 * - Never the word "booking". The user paid, the price is locked, a car is
 *   being found, money gets sorted, the car arrives.
