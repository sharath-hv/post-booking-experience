npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (redirects to `/quote`).

## Typography (Euclid Circular B)

Fonts are **not** committed as binaries here. Add licensed font files under **`public/font/`** and follow **[font/README.md](font/README.md)** so `app/globals.css` and `lib/euclid-font-preload.ts` load from those files. Until then, the repo may use hosted URLs in `globals.css` for local development.

## Docs

- Implementation notes: `docs/PLAN.md`  
- Local-only dev tools (gitignored): see `docs/PLAN.md` → “Local-only dev tools”.
